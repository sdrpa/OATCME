# How to use

- Drawing is only applied to the active layer. No other layer will be affected. Make sure you've selected a layer before starting the drawing on the layer.

- The active layer will be shown highlighted in the Layers Window.

- Each layer can be exported individually. (The exported file can be read by [AirspaceKit](https://github.com/sdrpa/oatcme))

- There are two modes: Map and Drawing. [SPACE] key toggles between map (zoom/move/rotate) and drawing mode.

- Use ⌘+Z / ⇧+⌘+Z (or Edit -> Undo/Redo) to undo and redo the changes to your drawing.
